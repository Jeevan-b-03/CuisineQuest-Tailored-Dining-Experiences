# CuisineQuest-Tailored-Dining-Experiences
CuisineQuest: Tailored Dining Experiences is a personalized restaurant recommendation system designed to help users discover the perfect dining options based on their unique preferences. In a city like Bengaluru, with thousands of restaurants offering a vast array of cuisines, finding the right place to eat can be overwhelming. CuisineQuest simplifies this process by leveraging advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and cosine similarity, to analyze user preferences and restaurant reviews. By processing user inputs like preferred cuisines, budget, and location, CuisineQuest identifies restaurants that closely match these criteria. Additionally, TF-IDF helps quantify the importance of words in reviews, while cosine similarity measures how closely these reviews align with a userâ€™s taste.
This dual analysis ensures that recommendations are both personalized and accurate, taking into account not only general trends but also the specific sentiments expressed in customer feedback. To manage the extensive and varied data involved, CuisineQuest utilizes MongoDB, a NoSQL database, as its backend. MongoDB efficiently stores and retrieves data related to restaurant details, reviews, and user preferences, providing the flexibility needed to scale as more data is added. This combination of NLP techniques and a robust database framework enables CuisineQuest to offer tailored, real-time restaurant recommendations, enhancing the dining experience by guiding users to the best options available based on their individual tastes.
