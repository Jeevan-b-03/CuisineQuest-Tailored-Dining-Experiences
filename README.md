# CuisineQuest-Tailored-Dining-Experiences
CuisineQuest: Tailored Dining Experiences is a personalized restaurant recommendation system designed to help users discover the perfect dining options based on their unique preferences. In a city like Bengaluru, with thousands of restaurants offering a vast array of cuisines, finding the right place to eat can be overwhelming. CuisineQuest simplifies this process by leveraging advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and cosine similarity, to analyze user preferences and restaurant reviews. By processing user inputs like preferred cuisines, budget, and location, CuisineQuest identifies restaurants that closely match these criteria. Additionally, TF-IDF helps quantify the importance of words in reviews, while cosine similarity measures how closely these reviews align with a userâ€™s taste.

This current study proposed a customized restaurant guide with streamlined restaurant-recommendation system to help a dweller discover great dining options in the very busy city of Bengaluru. Cuisine Quest employs advanced Natural Language Processing techniques such as TF-IDF and cosine similarity to analyze the preferences of users along with reviews regarding restaurants with an aim to deliver accurate and personalized recommendations. The system generates restaurants based on those input preferences about user preferences related to cuisine, dish, and desired location. By using the inputs about the user preferences related to cuisine, dish, and desired location the TF-IDF is used to determine the importance of keywords in reviews, and the cosine similarity computes the similarity between the reviews and user preference, thus ensuring personal taste factors are met in recommendations. Handling massive data related to restaurants, reviews, and user preferences, CuisineQuest relies on MongoDB as its backend. Such a NoSQL database is capable of storing and retrieving information efficiently with all the advantages of scalability and flexibility for real-time operations. With the state-of-the-art NLP methods combined with strong data management, it is bettering the dining experience by guiding users to restaurants best matching their distinctive preferences and expectations.
